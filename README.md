# Daily Word

A comprehensive Python script for vocabulary learning that fetches a random English word and displays:

- Definition and part of speech
- Pronunciation (with audio link when available)
- Difficulty level classification
- Etymology information
- Synonyms and antonyms
- Usage examples in different contexts
- Memory tips based on word structure
- Practice prompts for active learning

The script tracks your word history for spaced repetition learning using either MongoDB (if available) or local file storage.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Internet connection (to fetch words and their definitions)
- MongoDB (optional) for enhanced data storage

## Installation

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Use the provided setup script to create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment
2. Install all required dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file from the template if it doesn't exist

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development Installation

If you want to modify the code:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will install the package in development mode, allowing you to make changes to the code without reinstalling.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
# Using the standalone script
python daily_word.py

# Or using the package
python -m dailydose
```

The script will:
1. Fetch a random English word
2. Display comprehensive information for vocabulary learning
3. Save the word to your learning history (file or database)
4. If information isn't available for a word, it will automatically try another word

### MongoDB Configuration (Optional)

The script can store word history in MongoDB for enhanced functionality. You have two options to configure it:

#### Option 1: Using a .env file (Recommended)

1. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script (or use the setup script to create it)
2. Add your MongoDB connection details to the file:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
MONGODB_DB_NAME=word_learning
MONGODB_COLLECTION=word_history
```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your actual connection details.

#### Option 2: Using environment variables

Set the MongoDB connection string using environment variables:

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
export MONGODB_URI="mongodb://username:password@host:port/database"

# Windows
set MONGODB_URI=mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
```

Optional database configuration:

```bash
export MONGODB_DB_NAME="your_database_name"
export MONGODB_COLLECTION="your_collection_name"
```

#### MongoDB Permissions

The script will work with limited MongoDB permissions. If your MongoDB user does not have permissions to create indexes, the script will display a warning but continue to function normally.

If MongoDB connection fails or is not configured, the script will automatically fall back to local file storage.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite that covers all the major functionality of the Daily Word application. Tests are written using Python's built-in `unittest` framework.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
# Run tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests

# Or use the test runner with coverage
./run_tests.py
```

### Test Coverage

The project maintains excellent test coverage with 95% of the code covered by tests.

To check test coverage:

```bash
# Install coverage tool
pip install coverage

# Run tests with coverage tracking
coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests

# View coverage report
coverage report -m
```

### Test Structure

The tests are organized to mirror the package structure:

- `test_word_utils.py`: Tests for word retrieval, analysis, and related utilities
- `test_storage.py`: Tests for both MongoDB and local file storage functionality
- `test_display.py`: Tests for displaying word information to the console
- `test_main.py`: Tests for the main application flow

### Test Details

The tests cover:

- **API Interactions**: Tests for retrieving random words and word information from external APIs
- **Word Processing**: Tests for word difficulty classification, memory tips, and related word extraction
- **Storage Operations**: Tests for both MongoDB and local file storage functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests of the main application workflow
- **Edge Cases**: Tests for handling API failures, MongoDB connection issues, etc.

### Mocking

The tests use Python's `unittest.mock` to simulate external dependencies such as:

- API responses from dictionary and word list services
- MongoDB interactions
- File system operations
- Date/time functions

This ensures that tests can run reliably without requiring an actual internet connection or MongoDB instance.

## Learning Features

- **Difficulty Classification**: Words are labeled as Basic, Intermediate, or Advanced
- **Etymology Links**: Access to word origins via Etymonline
- **Mnemonic Techniques**: Memory tips based on prefixes and word structure
- **Learning History**: Words are saved to MongoDB (if available) or `word_history.json` for future reference
- **Audio Pronunciation**: Links to audio files when available
- **Practice Prompts**: Encourages active usage to reinforce learning

## APIs Used

- Random word list from MIT (www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000)
- Word definitions from Free Dictionary API (dictionaryapi.dev)
- Etymology links to Etymonline (etymonline.com)

## Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues

If you encounter MongoDB connection issues:

1. Verify your connection string in the `.env` file
2. Ensure your MongoDB user has appropriate permissions
3. Check if your MongoDB server is running and accessible

If issues persist, the script will use local file storage as a fallback.

## Email Functionality

The application can send beautifully formatted emails with the daily word information using AWS SES (Simple Email Service).

### Configuration

To enable email functionality:

1. Configure AWS credentials in the `.env` file:
```
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
EMAIL_SENDER=your.email@example.com
```

2. Add subscribers by either:
   - Setting a comma-separated list in the `.env` file:
     ```
     EMAIL_SUBSCRIBERS=user1@example.com,user2@example.com
     ```
   - Or by adding email addresses to the `subscribers.txt` file (one per line)

### Email Templates

Email templates use Jinja2 for formatting. The default template is automatically created in the `templates` directory the first time the application runs. You can customize this template to change the appearance of the emails.

### AWS SES Requirements

To use AWS SES:

1. You must have an AWS account
2. Set up and verify the sender email in the AWS SES console
3. If your account is in the SES sandbox, you'll need to verify recipient emails as well
4. Create an IAM user with SES send privileges and use its credentials

For more information, see the [AWS SES documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/Welcome.html).

### Customizing Templates

The default email template is created automatically, but you can modify it to suit your needs. The template uses HTML and CSS for styling and Jinja2 for dynamic content.

Key template variables available:
- `word`: The word being learned
- `phonetics`: Pronunciation information
- `meanings`: Word definitions and examples
- `difficulty`: The difficulty level of the word

### Scheduling Daily Execution at 9 AM CST

To run the application automatically every day at 9 AM CST:

1. **Create a shell script to run the application:**
   Create a file named `run_daily_word.sh` with the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /path/to/DailyDose
   source venv/bin/activate
   python daily_word.py
   deactivate
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_daily_word.sh
   ```

3. **Add a cron job:**
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   
   Add the following line to run at 9 AM CST (which is 14:00 UTC assuming CST is UTC-6, adjust if needed for Daylight Saving Time):
   ```
   0 14 * * * /path/to/DailyDose/run_daily_word.sh >> /path/to/DailyDose/cron.log 2>&1
   ```

4. **Verify the cron job:**
   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```

This will run your DailyDose application every day at 9 AM CST and log any output to cron.log for troubleshooting.
